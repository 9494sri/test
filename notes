Shell Scripting 



Variables 

* In shell scripting all variables in capital letters only 

Ex : PERSON1=Sri
	PERSON2=Siva

$PERSON1 - this is Called variable 

#!/bin/bash

PERSON1=sri
PERSON2=shiva

echo "$PERSON1 : Hi $PERSON2"
echo "$PERSON2 : Hello $PERSON1"
echo "$PERSON1 : How are you"
echo "$PERSON2 : I am fine"

We can use “${PERSON2} : Hello $PERSON1"



a centralise place to mention the values, if you change at one place, it will reflect at all the places where it is referred

DRY == Don't repeat yourself 

Use variables 


Run time variables - (arguments  or ors ) 

arguements or args --> run time variables -> no need to edit script

sh 04-variables.sh ramesh suresh


PERSON1=$1
PERSON2=$2


#!/bin/bash

echo "please enter your username" # this line is used to print the message

read -s USERNAME   # variable name is USERNAME and -s is used to hide the input

echo "usernaeme is $USERNAME"

echo "please enter your password" # this line is used to print the message

read -s PASSWORD  # variable name is PASSWORD and -s is used to hide the input
